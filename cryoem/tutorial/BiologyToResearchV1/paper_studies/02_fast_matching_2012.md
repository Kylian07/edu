# 🔎 Guided paper study: Fourier-constrained volumetric matching (2012)

**Publication crosswalk ID:** `S36` | **Prerequisites:** modules 03,04,07,10 | **Format:** 2 × 90-minute seminars + 1 analysis lab.

> Read the full original paper, especially methods and supplementary material. This is a structured *reading and critique tutorial*, not a claim to reproduce the exact authors' experiments.

## 1. Start from biology

**Research question:** How can alignment search exploit Fourier support and symmetry?

Draw the specimen, observation method, pixel/voxel representation and the biologically relevant inferred variable. Clearly mark whether that variable is observed directly, estimated statistically, or imported as a prior.

## 2. Reconstruction of the algorithm

Write a rigid-transformation objective; explain Fourier convolution for translation and the role of missing-wedge support.

For every model component, create a table of inputs, outputs, supervision, mathematics, and estimated compute complexity. Label each assumption, and identify which mathematical terms come directly from the paper rather than your approximation.

## 3. Minimal independent numerical experiment

Run modules 03,04,07,10, then implement one *small controlled ablation* changing exactly one of: noise level, tilt range, angular heterogeneity, prompt density, training labels, representation dimensionality or domain shift. Use independent synthetic seeds for development and test.

Required figure: baseline and changed-condition plots with identical scales, plus an appropriate quantitative score.

## 4. Evaluate with the right metrics

**Evaluation target:** Angular/translation errors, runtime and alignment stability across SNR.

Draw train / validation / test and biological specimen split diagram. Identify the unit of independence (particle, tomogram, sample, imaging session). Explain how leakage could inflate the published metric.

## 5. Paper critique and failure mode

**Key issue to investigate:** Incorrect rotations; anisotropic sampling; FFT boundary and padding effects.

Write a paragraph explaining what empirical test would falsify one central method claim, and a second paragraph evaluating what evidence is *not* established by the paper alone.

## 6. Biological cross-validation

Compare aligned half-map correlations rather than template-score alone.

Distinguish direct biological evidence from algorithm-dependent interpretation.

## 7. Journal-club deliverables and scoring

1. Annotated forward-model diagram (20 points).
2. Equation-by-equation explanation of the paper's central objective (20 points).
3. Replicable toy experiment or method ablation with at least two random seeds (25 points).
4. Metric and leakage critique (20 points).
5. Biology-grounded next experiment (15 points).
