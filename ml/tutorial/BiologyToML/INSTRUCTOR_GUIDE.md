# 🧑‍🏫 Instructor guide

For faculty, TAs and mentors who use **BiologyToML** alongside CMU 02-620 *Machine Learning for
Scientists*, as a bridge course for students entering computational biology, as a second course
on machine learning for biological research, or as structured self-study for undergraduate
researchers. Students should start from the [README](README.md). This guide covers formats,
learning outcomes, the map from the 02-620 lectures to the modules, how Level 2 supports a
modernised 02-620, per-module teaching notes, assessment, slide errata, and maintenance.

**Design principles.** (1) *Self-contained:* the notebooks teach the lecture content themselves —
definitions, derivations, worked examples, figures (re-created with code) and the "what you should
know" points — so students never need the slides; 📘 *Lecture notes* boxes summarise each part of
a lecture. (2) *Synthetic data with a known truth:* the repository stores no data or pictures;
every data set is simulated (see [`DATA.md`](DATA.md)), which lets every method be checked against
the truth (🧪 boxes). (3) *Implement, then use:* every algorithm is written from scratch before
production tools are named.

## 1 · Formats that work

| Format | Plan | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Companion to 02-620 (Level 1) | Part A before or in weeks 1–2, then the lecture-aligned schedule in the [README](README.md#following-02-620-week-by-week) | recitations can run the module's key section live; ✏️ exercises make good warm-up problems; 📘 boxes are ready-made revision sheets |
| A modernised 02-620 (Levels 1 + 2) | the week-by-week map in §4 | Level 2 modules cover count models, VAEs, attention, single-cell, sequence and protein ML, perturbations, uncertainty, generative models and experiment design |
| Second course / graduate elective (Level 2) | Part F (24–29) in weeks 1–6, then one or two application parts (G, H or I) and the capstone tracks | assumes Level 1; each module is ~3 h of guided work plus exercises |
| Bridge for incoming students | Modules 00–14 over a summer (≈ 7 h/week for 10 weeks), Parts D–E during the semester | front-loads the mathematics most students struggle with in weeks 2–6 |
| Lab onboarding / rotations | Part A, the Level 1 part matching the student's project, then the matching Level 2 track and a capstone track | pair with the topic tutorials in [`ml/tutorial`](../README.md) |

**Before week 1.** Ask students to open Module 00 in Colab and run it top to bottom (≈ 1 minute)
to catch account and browser problems early. No downloads are needed: every data set is
generated in the notebook.

The notebooks never point to slides, but instructors can use this map to align recitations with
lectures. Every substantive slide of each deck is taught in the listed modules (the authors
checked each deck slide by slide).

## 5 · Per-module teaching notes

Each line gives the one idea to land, the most common difficulty, and a discussion prompt.

| Module | Idea to land | Typical difficulty | Discussion prompt |
|---|---|---|---|

| 03 | Xw as a weighted sum; rank and invertibility | when N < J, why "infinitely many perfect fits" | Two SNPs in perfect LD: what can and can't the data tell us? |
| 04 | gradient = direction of steepest ascent; convexity | step-size intuition; matrix-calculus rules | Why is a concave log-likelihood good news? |

| 06 | MLE under Gaussian noise = least squares | the matrix derivation of the normal equations | Univariate GWAS hits vs joint regression: why do they disagree under LD? |
| 07 | ridge = Gaussian prior; lasso = sparsity via soft-thresholding | why L1 gives exact zeros | Is a lasso-selected SNP causal? What would you need to claim that? |

## 6 · Assessment

- **Checkpoints** (✅, with hidden answers) work as entry/exit tickets; 6–12 per module.
- **Lab notes** (📝 template at the end of each notebook): one per module; grade for correct
  inputs/outputs/method, a sensible failure mode and (Level 2) the ground-truth check result.
- **Derivation quizzes**: the table in [`STUDY_GUIDE.md` §3](STUDY_GUIDE.md#3-the-derivations-to-master)
  lists the derivations every student should reproduce on a blank page.
- **Hand calculations** that mirror exam questions: forward variables and the Viterbi table (19),
  information gains (10), naïve-Bayes counts (08), alarm-network queries (17), a k-means step and
  single-link merges (12), the SVM margin (11).
- **Level 2 mini-projects**: change one simulator parameter and report which methods break (e.g.
  stronger batch effect in 31, fewer sequences in 37, weaker instruments in 35, more noise in 41),
  with the ground-truth metric before and after.
- **Capstone** (Module 44): report + presentation + peer review. Suggested rubric (the notebook
  contains a student-facing version):

| Criterion | Excellent (4) | Adequate (2–3) | Insufficient (0–1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Question and evaluation contract | biological question, unit of replication, split, metric and baseline stated before analysis | most elements present | metric or split chosen after seeing results |
| Methods | several methods, each justified, tuned within training folds with a fixed budget | tuning partly ad hoc | test data used for tuning or selection |
| Results and uncertainty | fold spread, paired comparison or bootstrap CI, calibration where relevant; checked against simulated truth where available | point estimates with some spread | single numbers only |
| Interpretation | stability of selected features, limits of biological claims | some interpretation | causal claims from predictive models |
| Reproducibility and communication | seeded, runs end to end, clear figures and report, DOME checklist | minor gaps | cannot be rerun |

## 7 · Slide errata and clarifications found while writing the course

This section is for the instructors who maintain the 02-620 slides. While turning every slide
into self-contained notebook content, the authors found the following slips. The notebooks teach
the correct statement directly (usually in a ⚠️ "common slip" box), without referring to the
slides; the list below lets the slides be fixed in a future revision. Slide numbers are
PowerPoint numbers of the Spring 2025 decks.

| Deck | Slide(s) | Issue | Correct statement / how the notebook handles it |

| `012_HMM-DBN_mz_032425` | 90 | the displayed path A A A B B B B B B A A is not the Viterbi path of 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 | under the given parameters the most probable path is all A (1.75 × 10⁻⁸ vs 2.25 × 10⁻¹²); the notebook presents the displayed path as "a tempting answer" and verifies by brute force ([19](notebooks/19_hmm_inference.ipynb)) |
| `012_HMM-DBN_mz_032425` | 94–95 | "path defined by argmax_j δₜ(j)"; δ defined as a conditional | traceback through backpointers is required; δ is a joint probability |
| `012_HMM-DBN_mz_032425` | 108–109 | "moving window of size 2" for emissions | size 1 ([20](notebooks/20_hmm_learning.ipynb)) |
| `012_HMM-DBN_mz_032425` | 113 | "local minima" | local maxima of the likelihood |
| `012_HMM-DBN_mz_032425` | 124 | duration product index range; Poisson duration can be 0 | product over the segment t−l+1…t; 1 + Poisson(λ − 1) used |
| `013_Bayesian-MCMC_mz_032725` | 24 | p(wⱼ ∣ w₋ⱼ, data) called a "marginal" | a full conditional ([21](notebooks/21_bayesian_learning_mcmc.ipynb)) |
| `014_NN_mz_032725` | 16 | sigmoid with the opposite sign to slide 4 | flagged ([22](notebooks/22_neural_networks.ipynb)) |
| `014_NN_mz_032725` | 46–49 | δ rules assume squared error with sigmoid units (Mitchell), while slide 41 says "loss function" | both squared-error and cross-entropy rules derived |
| `015_model-selection_mz_040725` | 3 | "k-NN: number of clusters K"; "SVM: NA" | number of neighbours; SVMs need C, kernel and its parameters, class weights, preprocessing ([11](notebooks/11_support_vector_machines.ipynb), [23](notebooks/23_model_selection.ipynb)) |
| `015_model-selection_mz_040725` | 42–43 | BIC written as "min over θ" | minimise over models, each at its maximum-likelihood fit |

Two clarifications rather than errors are also handled throughout: more CV folds change the cost
and the bias/variance of the *estimate* (independence of samples matters more), and a learned
network edge or a lasso-selected feature is a statistical dependence, not a demonstrated mechanism.

## 8 · Technical notes and maintenance

- **Tested with** Python 3.13, NumPy 2.5, SciPy 1.18, pandas 3.0, scikit-learn 1.9, Matplotlib
  3.11, NetworkX 3.6 and PyTorch 2.14 (CPU). Every notebook runs in a few seconds to about two
  minutes on a 2-core CPU; the whole course in roughly half an hour.
- **Structure check:** `python validate_notebooks.py` checks the schema, required sections and
  header keys, Colab badges, stripped outputs, relative links, that every toolkit copy matches
  `course_toolkit.py`, that no notebook refers to lecture slides, embeds or links a picture, or
  reads/downloads data, and that no data files or files over 400 kB are stored. `--execute`
  also runs every notebook.
- **Editing a notebook:** edit in Jupyter, run it top to bottom, check that the narrative still
  matches the outputs (the simulations are seeded), then clear outputs before committing
  (`jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace notebooks/NN_*.ipynb`).
- **Changing a shared helper:** edit `course_toolkit.py`, then replace the definition in the
  🧰 toolkit cell of every notebook that uses it — the validator lists each stale copy. Changing a
  simulator changes the numbers in every notebook that uses it; re-check their narratives.
- **Data policy:** no data files, no pictures, no downloads (see [`DATA.md`](DATA.md)).
